- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM
- **JWT** - Authentication

### Frontend
- **Flutter Web** - Cross-platform web application
- **Riverpod** - State management
- **Dio** - HTTP client

- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration
- **Nginx** - Web server for Flutter frontend

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bjornerikmoen2/home-board.git
   cd home-board
   ```

2. **Create environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Or create .env directly with these values:
   cat > .env << EOF
   POSTGRES_DB=homeboard
   POSTGRES_USER=homeboarduser
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
   JWT_SIGNING_KEY=your_jwt_signing_key_min_32_chars_long
   BACKEND_PORT=8080
   FRONTEND_PORT=3001
   EOF
   ```
   
   **Important**: Change the passwords and JWT key to secure values!
   
   **Note**: Port configuration is optional. If not specified, the application uses defaults:
   - `BACKEND_PORT` defaults to `8080`
   - `FRONTEND_PORT` defaults to `3001`

3. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   The compose file will:
   - Pull pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry
   - Start PostgreSQL with health checks
   - Wait for database to be healthy before starting the API
   - Automatically run database migrations
   - Configure automatic restarts on failure

4. **Wait for services to start**:
   The database needs to initialize and the API will run migrations automatically.
   The database healthcheck ensures services start in the correct order.
   Wait about 30-60 seconds for everything to be ready.

5. **Access the application**:
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001
   - **API Swagger**: http://localhost:8080/swagger
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health

6. **Log in as the first admin**:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: the value of `Seed__AdminPassword` if you set it for the API; otherwise a random
     password, printed once in the API log on first start (`docker compose logs api`, look for
     "Created the first admin user")
   
   **⚠️ Change this password after the first login!**

### Managing Services

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api    # API logs
docker-compose logs -f web    # Frontend logs
docker-compose logs -f db     # Database logs

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data (fresh start)
docker-compose down -v

# Restart a single service
docker-compose restart api
docker-compose restart web

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose build api      # Rebuild API
docker-compose build web      # Rebuild frontend
docker-compose up -d          # Restart with new images
```

## Development Setup (Without Docker)

### Backend

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - .NET 10 SDK
   - PostgreSQL installed locally

2. **Configure database**:
   Update `backend/src/HomeBoard.Api/appsettings.Development.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "Default": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=homeboard;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd backend/src/HomeBoard.Api
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Run the API** (first set a JWT signing key, at least 32 bytes; there is no default):
   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets set Jwt:SigningKey "$(openssl rand -base64 48)"
   dotnet run
   ```
   API will be available at http://localhost:8080

### Frontend

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Flutter SDK (3.x or higher)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/home_board_web
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code** (for freezed models):
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

```

## Common Tasks

### Create a New User (Child)

1. Login as admin via Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger
2. Use the `/api/users` POST endpoint:
   ```json
   {
     "username": "johnny",
     "displayName": "Johnny",
     "password": "Kid123!",
     "role": 1
   }
   ```

### Create a Task Definition

POST to `/api/tasks/definitions`:
```json
{
  "title": "Make Bed",
  "description": "Make your bed every morning",
  "defaultPoints": 5
}
```

### Assign a Task

POST to `/api/tasks/assignments`:
```json
{
  "taskDefinitionId": "<uuid-from-previous-step>",
  "assignedToUserId": "<johnny-user-id>",
  "scheduleType": 0,
  "daysOfWeek": 127,
  "dueTime": "09:00:00"
}
```

**Schedule Types:**
- `0` = Daily
- `1` = Weekly  
- `2` = Once

**Days of Week (bit flags, sum them):**
- Sunday=1, Monday=2, Tuesday=4, Wednesday=8, Thursday=16, Friday=32, Saturday=64
- Example: `127` = All days (1+2+4+8+16+32+64)

### Complete and Verify a Task

1. **Kid marks task complete**:
   - GET `/api/me/today` to see assigned tasks
   - POST `/api/tasks/{assignmentId}/complete`

2. **Admin verifies**:
   - GET `/api/verification/pending`
   - POST `/api/verification/{completionId}/verify` with points:
     ```json
     {
       "pointsAwarded": 10
     }
     ```

### Scoreboard Display

The scoreboard feature provides a public, read-only display perfect for showing on a shared family tablet or screen.

**Key Features:**
- **Public Access**: No login required - accessible via `/scoreboard` route
- **Real-Time Updates**: Shows current standings and pending tasks for all family members
- **Points Leaderboard**: Users ranked by total points earned
- **Pending Tasks**: Displays today's incomplete tasks for each user
- **Shared Tasks**: Shows tasks assigned to all users (group tasks)
- **Theme Sync**: Automatically uses the admin's dark/light mode preference
- **Language Sync**: Uses admin's preferred language (English/Norwegian)
- **Profile Images**: Displays user profile pictures when available

**How to Access:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/scoreboard` (or your domain)
2. View is automatically updated when tasks are completed or points are awarded
3. No authentication needed - perfect for display on a shared device

**Enabling the Scoreboard:**
The scoreboard can be enabled/disabled in the Family Settings:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Settings
3. Toggle "Enable Scoreboard" on/off

**What's Displayed:**
- **User Cards**: Each family member gets a card showing:
  - Name and profile picture
  - Total points earned
  - Today's pending personal tasks
- **Shared Tasks Section**: Tasks assigned to all users appear at the top
- **Task Details**: Each task shows title and point value

**Best Practices:**
- Mount a tablet in a common area (kitchen, hallway) showing the scoreboard
- Kids can see what tasks need to be done without logging in
- Creates friendly competition and motivation
- Parents can quickly see who's completed their tasks

## Deployment

### Production Deployment

The docker-compose.yml file uses pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry, making deployment straightforward.

1. **Set environment variables** on your server:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with production values
   POSTGRES_DB=homeboard_prod
   POSTGRES_USER=homeboarduser
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong_password>
   JWT_SIGNING_KEY=<strong_random_key_at_least_32_chars>
   BACKEND_PORT=8080
   FRONTEND_PORT=3001
   ```

2. **Update docker-compose.yml** for production:
   - Use `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Production` in the `api` service (`docker-compose-ghcr.yml` does;
     Development turns on Swagger and detailed error pages)
   - Passwordless login (kids on the family tablet) only works from the home network: requests
     that arrive with a public client address, e.g. through a Cloudflare Tunnel, are refused. Set
     `Auth__AllowNoPasswordLoginFromInternet: "true"` to allow it from anywhere
   - Configure specific CORS origins (uncomment and set in docker-compose.yml)
   - Set `App__Timezone` if different from default `Europe/Oslo`
   - Set up proper SSL/TLS termination (reverse proxy recommended)
   - Configure ports via `.env` if different from defaults

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose pull  # Pull latest images
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   
   Services will:
   - Start with automatic restart on failure
   - Wait for database health checks before starting API
   - Run migrations automatically
   - Recover from failures without manual intervention

4. **First-time setup**:
   - Database tables are created automatically via migrations
   - Default admin user is created on first startup
   - Login and change the default password immediately!

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `homeboard` |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | Database user | `homeboarduser` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Database password | `securepassword123` |
| `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` | JWT signing key (min 32 chars) | `your-secret-key-min-32-chars` |

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `BACKEND_PORT` | Port for the backend API | `8080` | `8080` |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | Port for the frontend web application | `3001` | `3001` |
| `Cors__AllowedOrigins` | Comma-separated allowed CORS origins | `*` (all) | `https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com` |
| `App__Timezone` | Application timezone for date calculations | `Europe/Oslo` | `America/New_York` |

**Port Configuration:**
- Both `BACKEND_PORT` and `FRONTEND_PORT` are optional
- If not specified in `.env`, the application uses the default values
- The frontend automatically proxies API requests to the configured backend port
- Useful for avoiding port conflicts or deploying multiple instances

**CORS Configuration:**
- Default (`*`) allows all origins - suitable for development or flexible deployments
- For production, set specific origins in docker-compose.yml:
  ```yaml
  environment:
    Cors__AllowedOrigins: "https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com"
  ```
- Can also be configured in appsettings.json or via `.env` file
- Multiple origins separated by commas

**Service Reliability:**
- All services are configured with `restart: unless-stopped` for automatic recovery
- Database has built-in health checks to ensure availability
- API waits for database health check before starting
- Ensures proper startup order and automatic failure recovery

## API Documentation

Full API documentation is available at:
- **Interactive Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8080/swagger
- **Markdown docs**: [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)

## Architecture

For detailed architecture information, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

Key architectural decisions:
- **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns with Domain, Infrastructure, and API layers
- **Ledger Pattern** - All point transactions recorded, no balance field
- **Task Verification Flow** - Two-step process (complete → verify) for point awards
- **JWT Authentication** - Stateless authentication with role-based authorization

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection errors

Check that the database container is healthy:
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs db
```

The database has built-in health checks. If the API won't start, verify the database passes its health check before troubleshooting further.

### API not starting

Check API logs for migration errors:
```bash
docker-compose logs api
```

### Frontend build errors

Make sure code generation ran:
```bash
cd frontend/home_board_web
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Port conflicts

If ports 8080 or 3001 are in use, configure them in your `.env` file:
```bash
BACKEND_PORT=8081
FRONTEND_PORT=3002
```

No need to modify docker-compose.yml - the ports are configured via environment variables.

### Fresh start

Remove all containers and volumes:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```
